# PIMS-REU
Here is the code provided for my research on the PIMS instrument aboard Europa Clipper. 
- To generate a graph of the different noise levels across the TOTAL current spectra, use noiseLevels.py
- To generate a csv file of 1000 different temperatures corresponding to different instrument noise levels, use tempNoise.py
